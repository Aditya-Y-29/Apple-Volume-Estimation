# Apple Volume Estimation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on estimating the volume of individual apples using a dataset that consists of 200 sampled apples. Each apple is individually considered, and 10 images are captured for each apple from 10 different orientations, all taken from a fixed height. In total, the dataset contains 200 * 10 images. The primary objective is to develop a system that accurately estimates the volume of each individual apple based on the provided images.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises 200 sampled apples, and for each apple, there are 10 images captured from different orientations, providing a total of 200 * 10 images for volume estimation. All photos are captured from a fixed height.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop an estimation model capable of accurately determining the volume of each apple based on the provided images. This involves the use of image processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, or any other suitable methodologies.
